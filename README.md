# URL_Shortener
This project demonstrates the implementation of a URL shortener using Python. URL shortening is a widely used service on the internet that helps to reduce the length of long URLs for ease of use and sharing. With the help of libraries and APIs available in Python, we can create our own URL shortening service.
