# URL Shortener with Python

This project demonstrates the implementation of a URL shortener using Python. URL shortening is a widely used service on the internet that helps to reduce the length of long URLs for ease of use and sharing. With the help of libraries and APIs available in Python, we can create our own URL shortening service.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `pyshorteners` library (can be installed using `pip`)

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository or download the source code files.
2. Ensure that you have Python 3.x installed on your system.
3. Install the `pyshorteners` library by running the following command:

```shell
pip install pyshorteners
```

4. Open a text editor and create a new file named `url_shortener.py`.
5. Copy and paste the code provided below into the `url_shortener.py` file.
6. Save the file and close the text editor.

## Usage

1. Open the `url_shortener.py` file in a text editor.
2. The code provided includes a `shorten_url` function that takes a long URL as input and returns the shortened URL.
3. Use the `shorten_url` function to shorten the desired URL by passing it as an argument. For example:

```python
shortened_url = shorten_url("https://www.example.com/long-url")
print("Shortened URL:", shortened_url)
```

4. Run the `url_shortener.py` file using the following command:

```shell
python url_shortener.py
```

5. The program will generate and display the shortened URL.

## Customization

You can customize the code according to your specific requirements. For example, you can create a user interface to take input from the user or integrate the URL shortening functionality into an existing application.

## Note

This project utilizes the `pyshorteners` library to shorten URLs. It uses various URL shortening services under the hood. Make sure you have a stable internet connection to access these services.
